# Flappybird RL environment with Java

This project is mainly modified from [PLE](https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment).

Currently, this java flappybird provides <b>only</b> state-based state instead of image-based state.

## Usage

Please consider the `Run.java` file.

The game will be locked if you don't provide any actions.
